# this file demonstrates the interaction between EVCS and EV considering the malware propagation.

# get all EVCS: calculcate the probability of propagation via communication network.
# for CMS-based attack, we require the EVCS network company. and hop distance (e.g., # of communication layers.)

# for EV-based attack, we need an additional attribute: status to record S-I process.
# Also for EVCS, we need to track a SIDR process.
