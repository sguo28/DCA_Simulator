### Our previous work for Gasoline-Taxi-based Ride-Hailing System
This simulation platform is extended from our previous work "[DROP: Deep relocating option policy for optimal ride-hailing vehicle repositioning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X22003369)" that was accepted by Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies (see [Github repo here](https://github.com/sguo28/DROP_Simulator)).
